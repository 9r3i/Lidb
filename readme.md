Alhamdulillah, all praises only to Allah SWT, who created the universe. I cannot finish this class without Him.

Lidb is alternative database and custom portable database. Lidb stands for Luthfie improvement database.

Yes, this is the improvement of my earlier database classes, the same way as the custom portable database.

But this one is much more improved than Ldb, encrypted in 9r3i\deema and 9r3i\gr.
Faster dan powerful, that is the basic of Lidb.

This one has professional license, and only allowed to use for some application or software that has special permission from 9r3i himself. https://github.com/9r3i/Lidb/blob/master/license.txt
